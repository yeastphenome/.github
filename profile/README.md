Yeast Phenome is a collaborative project dedicated to building and maintaining a comprehensive compendium of systematic loss-of-function phenotypes for the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

As part of this effort, we systematically track, collect, and annotate all published phenotypic screens utilizing the yeast knock-out collection. We extract the data, standardize their format and structure, and make them readily available for search, download, and analysis. 

The project is run by Anastasia Baryshnikova (<abaryshk@gmail.com>) and her team (<https://github.com/baryshnikova-lab>).

Github hosts two repositories crucial to the success of the project:

1. [yp-data](https://github.com/yeastphenome/yp-data) which contains the Python code used to ingest, clean, transform, and normalize public data.
2. [yeastphenome.org](https://github.com/yeastphenome/yeastphenome.org) which contains the Python codebase for the [Yeast Phenome website](www.yeastphenome.org).
